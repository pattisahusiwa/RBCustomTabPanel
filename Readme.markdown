# ![](https://raw.github.com/alexrestrepo/RBComposer/master/class.png) RBCustom TabPanel

A Canvas-based tab panel that mimics the tabpanel in the RealBasic IDE (even with animations!).
You can attach a pagepanel to it, and you will have a full featured tabpanel, this class will handle the page changing, and page appending/removing if needed.
Each tab can have its own optional icon, and its own optional close box.

Update:
11/27/07 Fixed a bug that prevented captions from being properly updated.
Thanks to Neale Baker for pointing it out

2/21/06 The tabs can now face any direction: North, South, East, West.

9/1/05: Added a way to navigate to non-visible tabs as well as a way to "fit" as many tabs as possible by squeezing them together. A way to enable/disable tabs was also included.
